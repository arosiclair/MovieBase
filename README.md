# MovieBase
A team course project for the Databases course at Stony Brook University made by Andrew Rosiclair, Stanley Chen, and John French. 

We created a very simple web interface for a mock movie rental service. The service features Administrator, Employee, and Customer users with management and special functionality for each. The front end leverages some basic Bootstrap components and JQuery. The backend is a Java EE application that's configured to run on a GlassFish web server and uses standard Java SQL packages to access and update a MySQL database.
